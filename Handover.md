PLAYLIST PROTECTION PLUGIN - AI HANDOVER DOCUMENT
=====================================================

PURPOSE

This document is the single source of truth for:

  Current implementation state
  Verified Emby behaviour
  Architectural assumptions
  Target architecture
  Development ordering
  Task completion rules

The project state must always be recoverable from this document alone.

Any discrepancy between code and this document means the document is
outdated and must be updated.

Project is avilable on github (using bash for Claude) https://github.com/ginjaninja1/PosterToFolder


CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES
=====================================================

IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT IMPLIED BY CODE EXISTENCE

The following DO NOT mean a feature exists:

  A class exists
  A file exists
  A service is registered
  A name suggests functionality
  A partial implementation exists

A feature is ONLY considered implemented when ALL of the following are true:

  Code exists
  Code compiles
  Behaviour is tested
  Behaviour is validated
  Result is recorded in this document

Until then, it is UNIMPLEMENTED.

PROVISIONAL vs PROVEN

When recording findings, always state:
  PROVEN     — empirically confirmed in Emby runtime
  AGREED     — design decision confirmed by discussion, not yet runtime-tested
  ASSUMED    — working hypothesis, not yet tested
  DEFERRED   — intentionally left open pending more knowledge


CRITICAL AI DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVES
=====================================================

MATCH EXISTING PATTERNS
  Before writing any constructor, store, or class — find the closest
  existing equivalent in the codebase and mirror it exactly.
  Deviation requires explicit justification and approval before writing code.
  This applies to: constructor signatures, store patterns, file path resolution,
  dependency resolution, and serialisation.

NO GUESSING
  Never assume APIs exist, events exist, payload formats exist,
  behaviour exists. Verify everything.

SMALL STEPS ONLY
  One architectural step at a time.
  Must be tested before next step.

REALITY OVERRIDES DESIGN
  If code contradicts this document:
    Code is correct
    Document must be updated
    Assumptions must be corrected

NO PHASE SKIPPING
  Do not implement future stages early.

PROBE BEFORE PARSE
  When a new runtime value arrives (event payload, command args, etc.)
  log it raw first. Verify it matches assumptions before acting on it.

PROVEN vs PROVISIONAL
  Always distinguish empirically confirmed behaviour from agreed design
  decisions from untested assumptions. Working code is not proven design.

DO NOT MODIFY UIBaseClasses
  ControllerBase, PluginViewBase, PluginPageView, SimpleFileStore,
  SimpleContentStore, and related event args are project SDK wrappers.
  They are not to be modified.

FULL FILES ALWAYS
  Always provide complete files when making changes.
  Partial diffs cause integration errors.

PROJECT STRUCTURE (ACTUAL)
=====================================================




EMBY PLUGIN UI FRAMEWORK (FULLY AUDITED)
=====================================================

--- PLUGIN SIGNATURE (ACTUAL) ---

  public class ListProtectionPlugin : BasePlugin, IHasThumbImage, IHasUIPages

  IHasUIPages exposes UIPageControllers (IReadOnlyCollection<IPluginUIPageController>)
  MainController is the single entry in UIPageControllers.
  MainController also implements IHasTabbedUIPages — this is how tabs are achieved.
  The outer IHasUIPages + inner IHasTabbedUIPages pattern is PROVEN working.

--- TAB ARCHITECTURE ---

  MainController : ControllerBase, IHasTabbedUIPages
    Owns TabPageControllers (IReadOnlyList<IPluginUIPageController>)
    Each tab is a TabPageController — a generic factory taking a view factory func
    CreateDefaultPageView() on MainController returns Tab 1 view directly

  TabPageController : ControllerBase
    Constructor: (PluginInfo, name, displayName, Func<PluginInfo, IPluginUIView>)
    CreateDefaultPageView() invokes the factory func
    Stateless — view is constructed fresh on each navigation

--- UIBaseClasses (PROJECT SDK WRAPPERS — DO NOT MODIFY) ---

  ControllerBase
    abstract — requires PageInfo and CreateDefaultPageView()
    PluginId passed to base constructor

  PluginViewBase
    implements IPluginUIView, IPluginViewWithOptions
    ContentData (IEditableObject) — the EditableOptionsBase subclass
    RunCommand(itemId, commandId, data) — virtual, returns null by default
    RaiseUIViewInfoChanged() — triggers Emby re-render

  PluginPageView : PluginViewBase
    adds ShowSave, ShowBack, AllowSave, AllowBack
    OnSaveCommand(itemId, commandId, data) — virtual

  SimpleFileStore<T> where T : EditableOptionsBase, new()
    GetOptions() — loads from JSON on first call, cached thereafter
    SetOptions(T) — writes to JSON, fires FileSaving/FileSaved events
    ReloadOptions() — force reload from disk
    File path: PluginConfigurationsPath/{pluginFullName}.json

--- CLIENT-SERVER INTERACTION MODEL ---

  Emby UI is round-trip stateless:
  1. CreateDefaultPageView() called -> build view from store (pure projection)
  2. User interacts with UI element -> command fires
  3. Emby calls RunCommand(itemId, commandId, data) on the view
  4. RunCommand -> parse data -> update store -> rebuild ContentData -> return this
  5. Emby re-renders from returned view

  STABILITY RULE: Store is always source of truth.
  View is always a pure projection of store + live Emby data.
  Never hold mutable state on the view between round-trips.

--- DxDataGrid (PROVEN FROM DLL) ---

  Namespace: Emby.Web.GenericEdit.Elements
  Constructor: DxDataGrid(DxGridOptions options)
  No default constructor — DxGridOptions is always required.

  DxGridOptions constructor:
    DxGridOptions(object editObject, string keyExpr, bool multiSelect,
                  bool disableColumnChooser, bool showFilterRow, bool showHeaderFilter)

    editObject         — instance of row class; DxColumnBuilder derives columns from it
    keyExpr            — property name used as row key
    showFilterRow      — when true, adds a per-column text filter row
    showHeaderFilter   — when true, adds a multi-select popup filter on column headers
    Columns are auto-built from editObject's properties via DxColumnBuilder.

  DxGridOptions.onChangeCommand — property (lowercase camelCase)
    Type: DxGridOnChangeCommand
    Namespace: Emby.Web.GenericEdit.Elements.DxGrid

  DxGridOnChangeCommand properties (lowercase camelCase):
    commandId  string  — arrives as commandId in RunCommand

  DxGridOptions.editing — NULL by default; constructor never sets it.
    Without it all cells are read-only and onChangeCommand never fires.
    REQUIRED for interactive cells:
      editing = new DxGridEditing
      {
          mode = DxGridEditing.GridEditMode.cell,
          allowUpdating = true
      }

  DxGridEditing properties (from DLL):
    allowUpdating   bool?           — must be true for any editing
    allowAdding     bool?           — row add (not needed here)
    allowDeleting   bool?           — row delete (not needed here)
    mode            GridEditMode?   — row/batch/cell/form/popup
    startEditAction string          — "click" or "dblClick" (default: "click")
    refreshMode     GridEditRefreshMode?
    highlightEditableColumns bool?

  GridEditMode.cell — single click edits in place; widget fires onChangeCommand
  on value change with no Save button. Correct mode for toggle columns.

  DxGridOptions CONSTRUCTOR WIRES AUTOMATICALLY (from decompiled DLL — PROVEN):
    grouping    — DxGridGrouping { allowCollapsing=true, contextMenuEnabled=true, autoExpandAll=false }
    summary     — DxGridSummary with groupItems count badge keyed by keyExpr (free per group)
    headerFilter — DxGridHeaderFilter { visible=showHeaderFilter }
    filterRow    — DxGridFilterRow { visible=showFilterRow }
    sorting      — DxGridSorting { mode=multiple, showSortIndexes=true }
    scrolling    — virtual mode
    export       — enabled

  DxGridColumn — SETTABLE PROPERTIES RELEVANT TO THIS PROJECT (from DLL — PROVEN):
    dataField       string    — matches property name exactly (PascalCase) — PROVEN Tab 2
    groupIndex      double?   — set to 0 to group by this column initially — PROVEN Tab 2
    showWhenGrouped bool?     — set false to hide column when used for grouping
    autoExpandGroup bool?     — per-column group expand default
    allowEditing    bool?     — overrides editing.allowUpdating for this column
    allowGrouping   bool?     — set false to prevent user grouping by this column
    allowHeaderFiltering bool? — overrides headerFilter.visible for this column
    visible         bool?     — set false to hide column entirely
    visibleIndex    int?      — column order
    sortIndex       double?   — initial sort
    sortOrder       string    — "asc" or "desc"
    caption         string    — column header display text
    width           int?      — pixels or percent

  DxGridColumn POST-PROCESSING PATTERN (Tab 2 — PROVEN):
    After DxGridOptions construction, iterate options.columns and mutate by dataField:
      "Key", "IsSynthetic" -> visible = false, allowEditing = false
      "PlaylistName"       -> groupIndex = 0, showWhenGrouped = false,
                             autoExpandGroup = false, allowEditing = false,
                             allowHeaderFiltering = true
      "DetectedAt"         -> allowEditing = false, allowHeaderFiltering = true
      "Forget"             -> leave editable, allowHeaderFiltering = false
      default              -> allowEditing = false

  CURRENT USAGE — Tab 1 (PlaylistManagementUI):
    new DxDataGrid(
        new DxGridOptions(new PlaylistRow(), "Id", false, true, false, false)
        {
            editing = new DxGridEditing
            {
                mode = DxGridEditing.GridEditMode.cell,
                allowUpdating = true
            },
            onChangeCommand = new DxGridOnChangeCommand { commandId = "ToggleProtection" }
        })

  CURRENT USAGE — Tab 2 (MissingMembersUI):
    new DxDataGrid(
        new DxGridOptions(new MissingMemberRow(), "Key", false, true, true, true)
        {
            editing = new DxGridEditing
            {
                mode = DxGridEditing.GridEditMode.cell,
                allowUpdating = true
            },
            onChangeCommand = new DxGridOnChangeCommand { commandId = "ForgetMember" }
        })
    + column post-processing (see above)

--- ILibraryManager.GetItemList (PROVEN FROM DLL) ---

  Returns: BaseItem[] (array — use .Length not .Count)
  Overloads: (InternalItemsQuery), (InternalItemsQuery, CancellationToken),
             (InternalItemsQuery, IDataContext, CancellationToken)

--- IScheduledTask (PROVEN FROM DLL — Task 5a) ---

  Interface: MediaBrowser.Model.Tasks.IScheduledTask
  DI-resolved by Emby assembly scanner — same pattern as IServerEntryPoint.

  Members (PROVEN from decompiled DLL):
    string Name { get; }
    string Key { get; }
    string Description { get; }
    string Category { get; }
    Task Execute(CancellationToken cancellationToken, IProgress<double> progress)
    IEnumerable<TaskTriggerInfo> GetDefaultTriggers()

  Appears in Emby dashboard under Scheduled Tasks — has manual Run button.
  Category groups tasks in the dashboard UI.
  GetDefaultTriggers() returning Array.Empty<TaskTriggerInfo>() = manual run only.
  Stores accessed via ListProtectionPlugin.Instance (same pattern as IServerEntryPoint).
  Constructor injection of ILibraryManager and ILogManager works normally.
  Namespace: ListProtection.Tasks   CONFIRMED (from DetectMissingMembersTask.cs)


STORAGE ARCHITECTURE
=====================================================

PATTERN A — SimpleFileStore<T> where T : EditableOptionsBase
  Framework-coupled. T is both stored object and UI definition.
  GetOptions() / SetOptions(T) API.
  Used for: ConfigStore (acceptable, stays as-is)

PATTERN B — Plain store (no base class)
  Stores any plain type. No framework coupling.
  You own serialisation, locking, file path.
  Constructor signature: (IApplicationHost applicationHost, ILogger logger, string pluginFullName)
  File path resolved via: applicationHost.Resolve<IApplicationPaths>().PluginConfigurationsPath
  Serialiser resolved via: applicationHost.Resolve<IJsonSerializer>()
  FileSystem resolved via: applicationHost.Resolve<IFileSystem>()
  All stores use lock object for thread safety.
  Used for: PlaylistManagementStore, GroundTruthStore, MissingMembersStore, CandidateStore

  CRITICAL: Always match this exact constructor signature when adding new Pattern B stores.
  Never resolve path or serialiser differently from the existing stores.

CURRENT STORES

  ConfigStore : SimpleFileStore<ConfigUI>
    File: List Protection.Configuration.json
    Status: Pattern A — acceptable, no change needed

  PlaylistManagementStore (Pattern B)
    File: List Protection.Playlist.json
    API: Load() -> HashSet<string>, Save(HashSet<string>)
    Stores Guid "N" format strings of protected playlist IDs
    Status: PROVEN

  GroundTruthStore (Pattern B)
    File: List Protection.GroundTruth.json
    API: Load() -> Dictionary<string, GroundTruthEntry>, Save(Dictionary<string, GroundTruthEntry>)
    Key: playlist Guid "N" format string
    Value: GroundTruthEntry (PlaylistName, CapturedAt, IsActive, Members)
    Soft-delete: IsActive = false when playlist unprotected (entry retained)
    Status: PROVEN

  MissingMembersStore (Pattern B)
    File: List Protection.MissingMembers.json
    API: Load() -> List<MissingMemberEntry>, Save(List<MissingMemberEntry>)
    Structure: FLAT LIST (not keyed by playlist)
    Rationale: cross-playlist identity — repair/candidate valid for Member.Id on one
               playlist is valid on all playlists. Flat list makes this a simple
               Where clause. Per-playlist lookup is equally simple.
    Status: PROVEN (2026-06-27)

  CandidateStore (Pattern B)                                            (Task 6)
    File: List Protection.Candidates.json
    API: Load() -> List<CandidateEntry>, Save(List<CandidateEntry>)
    Structure: FLAT LIST, sorted by Score descending on save
    Status: WRITTEN — not yet run

GROUND TRUTH ENTRY SHAPE

  GroundTruthEntry
    PlaylistName    string    — snapshot-time name, for troubleshooting only
                                not used for logic; name may change after capture
    CapturedAt      DateTime  — UTC timestamp of snapshot
    IsActive        bool      — false = soft-deleted, snapshot retained
    Members         List<GroundTruthMember>

  GroundTruthMember
    InternalId      long      — Emby internal ID, fast for in-process lookup
    Id              string    — Guid "N", durable across restarts
    Name            string    — item name at capture time
    Path            string    — file path at capture time
    ListItemEntryId long      — for correlating PlaylistItemsRemoved events
                                PROVEN populated at capture time (Task 3)
                                PROVEN round-trip: add=68, remove=68 (Task 4)

MISSING MEMBER ENTRY SHAPE

  MissingMemberEntry
    PlaylistId      string            — Guid "N", matches key in GroundTruthStore
    PlaylistName    string            — from ground truth at detection time, display only
    DetectedAt      DateTime          — UTC, when member was first identified missing
    Member          GroundTruthMember — full snapshot from ground truth at detection time
                                        Member.Id (Guid "N") is cross-playlist identity key

CANDIDATE ENTRY SHAPE                                                   (Task 6)

  CandidateEntry
    PlaylistId            string            — Guid "N", matches key in GroundTruthStore
    PlaylistName          string            — display only
    MissingMember         GroundTruthMember — the member this candidate was found for
    CandidateInternalId   long              — InternalId of candidate library item
    CandidateId           string            — Guid "N" of candidate library item
    CandidateName         string            — Name at discovery time
    CandidatePath         string            — Path at discovery time
    Score                 int               — composite score, higher is better
    MatchedSignals        List<string>      — human-readable signal breakdown
    DiscoveredAt          DateTime          — UTC

CANDIDATE SCORING SIGNALS (AGREED — not yet runtime proven)

  Signals are derived from GroundTruthMember.Name and .Path only
  (those are the only fields captured in ground truth).

  FilenameStemExact      100 — candidate FileNameWithoutExtension == GT path stem (case-insensitive)
  FilenameStemNormalized  70 — after stripping "NN. " track prefix, stems match
  NameExact               60 — candidate Name == GT Name (case-insensitive)
  NameNormalized          40 — after normalising whitespace/case, names match
  ParentFolderMatch       20 — immediate parent folder name matches
                               (year prefix "[YYYY] " stripped before comparison)

  Minimum score to record: > 0
  Store sorted by Score descending on save.
  Deduplication: (PlaylistId, MissingMember.InternalId, CandidateInternalId) triple.

GROUND TRUTH RECONCILE LOGIC (called from RunCommand after every save)

  1. For every entry in store not in protected set -> set IsActive = false (soft-delete)
  2. For every id in protected set:
       If active entry exists -> no action
       If soft-deleted entry exists -> restore IsActive = true (silently for now)
       If no entry exists -> capture fresh snapshot via CaptureMembers
  3. Save updated store

  CaptureMembers queries:
    First: GetItemList(IncludeItemTypes=Playlist) to find playlist BaseItem by Guid
    Then:  GetItemList(ListIds=[playlist.InternalId]) to get members
    Same ListIds pattern used internally by Playlist.SetQueryOptions

GROUND TRUTH MAINTENANCE LOGIC (PlaylistMaintenanceService — Task 4)

  On PlaylistItemsAdded (PROVEN):
    Check if playlist is protected (load PlaylistManagementStore via Instance)
    If protected: record ListItemId(s) in _pendingAdds keyed by playlist InternalId
    Await ItemUpdated for correlation

  On ItemUpdated (Type == Playlist) (PROVEN):
    Check if pending add correlation exists (_pendingAdds.TryRemove)
    If so: readback via playlist.GetItemList(new InternalItemsQuery())
    Match InternalId -> recover ListItemEntryId
    Duplicate guard: skip if ListItemEntryId already present in ground truth
    Add new GroundTruthMember, save store

  On PlaylistItemsRemoved (PROVEN):
    Check if playlist is protected
    If protected: iterate members backwards, match ListItemEntryId, remove
    Save store if any removed

MISSING MEMBER DETECTION LOGIC (MissingMemberDetector — Task 5/5a — PROVEN)

  RunDetection(targetPlaylistIdN, libraryManager, logger):
    For each active GroundTruthEntry (filtered to target if provided):
      1. Find playlist BaseItem by Guid via GetItemList(IncludeItemTypes=Playlist)
      2. Get live members via GetItemList(ListIds=[playlist.InternalId])
      3. Build HashSet<long> of live InternalIds
      4. For each ground truth Member:
           If InternalId absent from live set -> missing candidate
           Dedup: skip if already in MissingMembersStore for same PlaylistId+InternalId
           Add MissingMemberEntry, set changed=true
      5. If changed: save MissingMembersStore

  Trigger paths:
    Timer: 60-minute interval, 2-minute initial delay after startup   PROVEN
    Fast path (ItemRemoved): active, fires targeted detection          PROVEN (Task 5a)
    Manual (IScheduledTask): DetectMissingMembersTask                 PROVEN (Task 5a)

FORGET SEMANTICS (MissingMembersPageView — PROVEN 2026-06-27)

  Forget = permanent removal from both stores.
  RunCommand finds rows where Forget==true and IsSynthetic==false.
  For each:
    Remove matching MissingMemberEntry from MissingMembersStore
    Remove matching Member (by InternalId) from GroundTruthStore entry
  Save both stores. Rebuild view.
  Member is no longer tracked, never surfaces again.

MISSING MEMBER KEY FORMAT

  Real row key:       "{PlaylistId}_{Member.InternalId}"
    PlaylistId is always 32 hex chars (Guid "N").
    Parsing: PlaylistId = Key.Substring(0, 32), InternalId = long.Parse(Key.Substring(33))

  Synthetic row key:  "synthetic_{PlaylistId}"
    RunCommand identifies these by IsSynthetic == true and skips entirely.

CANDIDATE DISCOVERY LOGIC (CandidateDiscoverer — Task 6 — WRITTEN, NOT YET PROVEN)

  RunDiscovery(targetPlaylistIdN, libraryManager, logger):
    1. Load MissingMembersStore, GroundTruthStore, CandidateStore
    2. Query all Audio items once: GetItemList(IncludeItemTypes=["Audio"], Recursive=true)
    3. For each MissingMemberEntry (filtered to target if provided):
         Build exclusion set from ground truth for that playlist
         Score each Audio item not in exclusion set against the missing member
         Record candidates with score > 0
         Dedup by (PlaylistId, MissingMember.InternalId, CandidateInternalId)
    4. If any new candidates: sort store by Score desc, save CandidateStore

  Trigger paths:
    Manual (IScheduledTask): CandidateDiscoveryTask   WRITTEN — not yet proven


VERIFIED EMBY BEHAVIOURAL LEARNINGS
=====================================================

These behaviours have been empirically tested and confirmed.

--- SDK / API NOTES ---

  The online Emby API docs and the actual 4.9.1.90 DLL sometimes disagree.
  Always verify against the decompiled assembly when in doubt.

  BaseItem.InternalId   — long property (docs show it, DLL confirms it)
  Folder.GetItemList()  — returns BaseItem[] (array), NOT List<BaseItem>
                          Use .Length not .Count
  ILibraryManager.GetItemList() — returns BaseItem[] (array)
                          Use .Length not .Count
  MediaBrowser.Server.Core NuGet (4.9.1.90) contains all necessary
  assemblies including Emby.Web.GenericEdit. No additional packages needed.

--- AUDIO ITEM FIELDS (PROVEN FROM PROBE — 2026-06-27, Task 6) ---

  All fields confirmed populated on Audio items returned from
  GetItemList(IncludeItemTypes=["Audio"], Recursive=true):

    BaseItem.Name                     — populated
    BaseItem.Path                     — populated
    BaseItem.FileName                 — populated (computed from Path)
    BaseItem.FileNameWithoutExtension — populated (computed from Path)
    BaseItem.Album                    — populated
    BaseItem.RunTimeTicks             — populated (long?)
    BaseItem.IndexNumber              — populated (int?, null for non-disc albums)
    BaseItem.ParentIndexNumber        — null in test library (single-disc)
    BaseItem.ProductionYear           — populated (int?)
    Audio.Artists                     — populated (lazy-load via EnsureTaggedItemsLoaded
                                        is NOT required — field populates from GetItemList)
    Audio.AlbumArtists                — populated (same)

  Cast pattern: (item as Audio) to access Audio-specific fields.
  Cast returns null if item is not Audio subtype — guard before use.

--- PLAYLIST UI REMOVAL ---

  When a user removes an item from a playlist via Emby UI:
    Playlist updates immediately
    Underlying m3u updates immediately

--- EXTERNAL FILE DELETION ---

  When media is deleted outside Emby:
    Emby detects change during library scan
    Item is removed from library
    ILibraryManager.ItemRemoved fires immediately on detection
    Playlist membership is updated (item absent from live readback)
    PROVEN: live GetItemList readback after deletion correctly excludes the item
    PROVEN: ItemRemoved fires before the PlaylistEventProbe log line appears —
            fast path detection completes before the probe even logs the event

--- MEDIA RESTORATION ---

  When deleted media is restored:
    Emby does NOT automatically restore playlist membership
    Manual repair is required

--- EVENT OBSERVABILITY (TASK 1 — FULLY VERIFIED) ---

  EVENTS THAT FIRE ON PLAYLIST MEMBERSHIP CHANGE:

    IPlaylistManager.PlaylistItemsAdded   fires on member add
    IPlaylistManager.PlaylistItemsRemoved fires on member remove
    ILibraryManager.ItemUpdated           fires after add (not after remove)

  NOTE: ILibraryManager.ItemAdded and ItemRemoved do NOT fire for
  playlist membership changes.

  PAYLOAD — PlaylistItemsAdded (PlaylistItemsAddedEventArgs):
    Playlist         — the Playlist object (Name, InternalId, Id, Path)
    ListItem[]       — one per added item
      ListItemEntryId  — always 0 at event time (not yet assigned)
      ListItemId       — InternalId of the media item being added

  PAYLOAD — PlaylistItemsRemoved (PlaylistItemsRemovedEventArgs):
    Playlist         — the Playlist object
    long[]           — ListItemEntryIds of the removed entries

  PAYLOAD — ILibraryManager.ItemUpdated (ItemChangeEventArgs):
    Item             — the Playlist as a BaseItem
      Type             — "Playlist"
      InternalId       — playlist internal ID (long)
      Id               — playlist GUID
      Path             — path to .m3u file

  PAYLOAD — ILibraryManager.ItemRemoved (ItemChangeEventArgs) — PROVEN 2026-06-27:
    Same type as ItemUpdated: ItemChangeEventArgs
    Item.Type        — "Audio" (the media item type, not "Playlist")
    Item.Name        — media item name
    Item.InternalId  — media item InternalId (long) — CONFIRMED POPULATED
    Item.Id          — media item Guid
    Item.Path        — original file path
    Example: Type=Audio | Name=What I Wouldn't Do | InternalId=7274
             Id=8c97b172-e640-df0a-f63d-471ec26d41f2
             Path=D:\Music Test\A Fine Frenzy\[2009] Bomb in a Birdcage\01. What I Wouldn't Do.flac

  IMPORTANT: ItemRemoved fires for ANY library item deletion, not just playlist members.
  Fast path must check whether removed InternalId appears in any active ground truth entry
  before triggering detection. Guard is present in OnItemRemoved.

--- LISTITERENTRYID ASSIGNMENT (CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FINDING) ---

  ListItemEntryId is NOT available at PlaylistItemsAdded event time (always 0).
  It is assigned by Emby during the DB write that follows.
  ILibraryManager.ItemUpdated fires after the DB write is complete.

  RESOLUTION STRATEGY (PROVEN):
    1. PlaylistItemsAdded fires -> record ListItemId (e.g. 19071)
    2. ILibraryManager.ItemUpdated fires for same playlist
    3. Call playlist.GetItemList(new InternalItemsQuery())
    4. Each returned BaseItem has InternalId and ListItemEntryId populated
    5. Match InternalId == ListItemId -> recover ListItemEntryId (e.g. 68)

--- ROUND-TRIP PROOF (Blue Christmas, 2026-06-24) ---

  Add event:    ListItemId=7285, ListItemEntryId=0
  Readback:     InternalId=7285, ListItemEntryId=68
  Remove event: ListItemEntryId=68  <- exact match

--- ROUND-TRIP PROOF (Child In Time, 2026-06-26, Task 4) ---

  Add event:    ListItemId=19071, ListItemEntryId=0 (queued in _pendingAdds)
  Readback:     InternalId=19071, ListItemEntryId=68  <- assigned after ItemUpdated
  Ground truth: member written with ListItemEntryId=68
  Remove event: ListItemEntryId=68 -> member matched and removed
  Ground truth: member absent from file
  End-to-end maintenance cycle PROVEN.

--- MISSING MEMBER DETECTION PROOF (What I Wouldn't Do, 2026-06-27, Task 5) ---

  File deleted externally: D:\Music Test\A Fine Frenzy\[2009] Bomb in a Birdcage\01. What I Wouldn't Do.flac
  Library scan detected deletion.
  ItemRemoved fired:  InternalId=7274, Type=Audio
  Detection timer fired at 2-minute initial delay.
  Live readback: 11 members returned — InternalId=7274 absent.
  Ground truth: 12 members including InternalId=7274.
  Result: MissingMemberEntry written to MissingMembersStore.
  Tab 2: missing member displayed grouped under PLaylist 1.
  Forget actioned: both MissingMembersStore and GroundTruthStore updated correctly.
  UI: row disappeared after forget.
  Full Task 5 cycle PROVEN end-to-end.

--- FAST PATH AND SCHEDULED TASK PROOF (Swan Song, 2026-06-27, Task 5a) ---

  File deleted externally: D:\Music Test\A Fine Frenzy\[2009] Bomb in a Birdcage\06. Swan Song.flac
  LibraryMonitor detected change at 05:41:46.
  Fast path fired at 05:41:56 — before ItemRemoved probe log line appeared.
  Fast path ran targeted detection for playlist e617f097c8d08fa563aa29b7118d898c.
  Live readback: 7 members — InternalId=7279 (Swan Song) absent.
  MissingMemberEntry written to MissingMembersStore.
  Subsequent manual task run at 05:42:19: Swan Song correctly deduplicated.
  Manual task also ran at 05:40:17 and 05:41:51 with correct dedup of 3 earlier entries.
  Full Task 5a cycle PROVEN end-to-end.

--- REMOVE EVENT DOES NOT FIRE ItemUpdated ---

  When an item is removed via UI, only PlaylistItemsRemoved fires.
  ILibraryManager.ItemUpdated does NOT follow a remove.
  This means no readback is needed or possible on remove —
  the ground truth system must already hold the mapping.

--- ISERVICEENTRYPOINT AND STORE ACCESS PATTERN (PROVEN — 2026-06-26) ---

  IServerEntryPoint implementations are DI-resolved by Emby's assembly scanner.
  They cannot receive stores via constructor injection (stores are not DI-registered).
  Access stores via ListProtectionPlugin.Instance (static, set at end of Plugin
  constructor — safe to read from Run() onwards, as Run() is called after all
  plugins are constructed).
  PlaylistMaintenanceService, MissingMemberDetectionService, and
  DetectMissingMembersTask all use this pattern.

--- RunCommand PAYLOAD (PROVEN — 2026-06-26) ---

  itemId   — always null when fired from DxDataGrid cell edit.
             keyExpr does NOT route to itemId. Ignore itemId entirely.

  commandId — arrives correctly as the value set in
              DxGridOnChangeCommand.commandId.

  data     — contains the ENTIRE ContentData object serialised as JSON.
             Deserialise as the full UI class and extract rows of interest.
             Do NOT attempt toggle-by-id logic — the full state is in data.

--- DxDataGrid EDITING (PROVEN FROM DLL — 2026-06-26) ---

  DxGridOptions.editing is NULL by default — the constructor never sets it.
  Without it, all cells render read-only and onChangeCommand never fires.

--- DxDataGrid GROUPING (PROVEN — 2026-06-27, Tab 2) ---

  groupIndex = 0 on PlaylistName column produces correct grouping.
  Groups collapsed by default (autoExpandAll=false in DxGridGrouping).
  Count badge per group header works automatically via DxGridSummary.
  showWhenGrouped = false correctly hides the PlaylistName data column.
  dataField values match property names exactly (PascalCase) — CONFIRMED.

--- ListItemEntryId AT CAPTURE TIME (PROVEN — 2026-06-26) ---

  ListItemEntryId is correctly populated when reading playlist members
  via ILibraryManager.GetItemList with ListIds outside of an event context.

--- CANDIDATE FIELD PROBE (PROVEN — 2026-06-27, Task 6) ---

  Probe: CandidateDiscoveryProbeTask run against 64 Audio items in library.
  Missing member target: 'New Heights' | InternalId=7275
    Path: D:\Music Test\A Fine Frenzy\[2009] Bomb in a Birdcage\02. New Heights.flac
  Ground truth exclusion: 11 items excluded (playlist members), 1 excluded (the target itself).
  5 candidates logged raw. All fields confirmed populated — see AUDIO ITEM FIELDS above.
  Expected best candidate: InternalId=20474
    Path: D:\Music Test\New Folder Location\02. New Heights.flac
    Expected score: 160 (FilenameStemExact:100 + NameExact:60)
